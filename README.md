:construction: project is in early stage of development, come back in July for hopefully functional version :construction:

# GENETic ALgorithmS #
This project aims to provide a simple toolset for playing with genetic algorithms
- what this project **is** (or at least pretends to be)
  - easy to use
  - modular, extendable
  - developed with emphasis on visual feedback when prototyping GAs (Jupyter notebooks included)
  - a bit buggy
  - in development
- what this project **is not**
  - the fastest, most optimized super-scalable piece of scientific code ever made

## Installation ##
Clone repository, `cd` into it
```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/proste/genetals.git
$ cd genetals
```

(optionally) create virtual environment and activate it
```shell
$ python3 -m venv env_genetals
$ . env_genetals/bin/activate
```

install requirements (use `pip3` if not using python3 environment)
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

run jupyter notebook (try `sga.ipynb` first)
```shell
$ jupyter notebook
```

The installation proces will be changed in future, making this package installable via `setup.py` or even `pip`
