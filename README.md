# GENETic ALgorithmS
This project aims to provide simple toolset for playing with genetic algorithms
- what this project **is** (or at least pretends to be)
  - easy to use
  - modular, extendable
  - developed with emphasis on visual feedback when prototyping GAs (Jupyter notebooks included)
  - a bit buggy
  - in development
- what this project **is not**
  - the fastest, most optimized super-scalable piece of scientific code ever made
